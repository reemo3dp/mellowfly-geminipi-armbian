# Mellow Fly Gemini v3 / Pi Stock Armbian

The goal of this project is to provide patches that re-create a stock armbian image as close to the "official" images.

The patch was initially entirely based off the [`flypi`](https://github.com/mellow-3d/build/tree/flypi) branch on Mellow-3D's fork of Armbian, with some work to map Pins to the board schematic.

## Installation

Head to the [latest release](https://github.com/reemo3dp/mellowfly-geminipi-armbian/releases/latest) and download one of the `img.xz` files - `current` for a stable armbian kernel, `edge` for the latest mainline kernel supported by armbian. Both should work with all periphals (M2WE included).

Unpack the `xz`-archive and etch the image to an SD card using your favorite tool (e.g. balenaEtcher).

### M2WE

Use `nand-sata-install` to copy the system to the eMMC. 

If this is not enough to boot without the SD card into armbian, boot onto the SD Card and follow 
https://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_eMMC#Installation_from_Linux to make the boot partitions bootable (eMMC should be `mmcblk2`). `u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin` should be in `/usr/lib/linux-u-boot-current-mellowflygeminipi/u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin`. It should be written to both boot partitions of the eMMC.

Mainline kernel comes with a kernel for the wifi chipset (`rtw88_8821cs`) that can fail to initialize on boot. if that happens, blacklist the module and modprobe it later during boot. `options rtw88_core disable_lps_deep=y` might also help, or installing the scripts and systemd service in `./contrib/`.

## Building yourself

```bash
# Check out armbian's build repository
$ git clone https://github.com/armbian/build/ armbian
$ cd armbian/
# Apply patches from this repository
$ git am ../patches/*.patch
# Compile ubuntu jammy with default kernel config
$ ./compile.sh BOARD=mellowflygeminipi BRANCH=current RELEASE=jammy BUILD_MINIMAL=no BUILD_DESKTOP=no KERNEL_CONFIGURE=no INSTALL_HEADERS=yes
```

## Status

| Kernel    | OS      | Status                     |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| `current` | `jammy` | Everything works, M2WE WiFi fails to initialize but can be reinitialized later  |
| `edge` | `jammy` | Everything works, M2WE WiFi fails to initialize but can be reinitialized later |
